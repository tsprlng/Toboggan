######################################################

There are 2 methods to authenticate:
1. Form based starting s session:
	Post "username" and "password" to rest.php&action=login. The password must be a sha256 hash of the password.

2. A HTTP header can be sent with each request to authenticate in the form:

	X-US-Authorization: method userStr|passStr

	where method is US-Auth1, userStr is the username base64 encoded, and passStr is a sha256 hash of the password encoded in base64
