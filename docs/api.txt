There are 2 methods to authenticate:
1. Form based starting s session:
	Post "username" and "password" to rest.php&action=login. The password must be a sha256 hash of the password.

2. A HTTP header can be sent with each request to authenticate in the form:

	X-US-Authorization: method userStr|passStr

	where method is US-Auth1, userStr is the username base64 encoded, and passStr is a sha256 hash of the password encoded in base64

# API Versions :							 		 #
######################################################

Every request must include an apiver={apiversion} argument or the request will be rejected. If the version sent by the client is unsupported a 
412 Precondition failed HTTP response will be sent.

# API Keys :								 		 #
######################################################

Access to the REST api requires an apikey. Every request must include an apikey={yourapikey} argument or the request will be rejected.

		],
		Files:[
			{
				filename: "nameOfFile",

				streamers: [
					{
						extension: "extension representing the format of the media stream which will be output by this streamer e.g.(mp3)",
						streamerID: "ID number of streamer",
						mediaType: "The media type which this streamer outputs",
					}
					...
				],
			},
			...
		],
	}
	
getStream
	args:

	Returns a JSON object in the form:
	[
		{
			"mediaSourceID": "id"
			"results":
			[
				"dirs":
				[
					{
						"path": "path of the dir" // path relative to the mediaSource root (does not include the dirname which matched the query)
						"name": "filename" // the name of the dir which matched the query
					}
					...
				]
				"files":
				[
					{
						"path": "path of the file" // path relative to the mediaSource root (does not include the filename which matched the query)
						"fileObject": 
						{
							"filename": "nameOfFile",
							"displayName": "givenNameOfFileWhichShouldBeDisplayed",
							"streamers": [
								{
									"extension": "extension representing the format of the media stream which will be output by this streamer e.g.(mp3)",

									"mediaType": "The media type which this streamer outputs",
								}
								...
							]
						},
					},
					...
				]
			]
		},
